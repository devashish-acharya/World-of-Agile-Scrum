# What am I?

Here, you learn the basics of Agile Scrum. 

Firstly, **Agile** is an iterative approach to project management and software development which provides ideas and pathways to deliver values to costumer in the most efficient way. Where **Agile** may be considered a **mindset**, **Scrum** is **implimenting** that mindset into something to get the result

So to expand, **scrum** is a framework for efficient and a high standard of collaboration. It is heavily embraced in the world of software engineering as it accepts changes openly but can be applied to all kinds of teamwork.

***Remember, Scrum can help you get more "Agile"***

# How exactly does Scrum work?

When a team uses scrum in a project, the product is built in a series of iterations called **Sprint**. This breaks down big complex projects into **bitesize pieces**. Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of **"delivering working software frequently"** as it drastically increases the efficiency of a project.

### Diving deeper, now we learn about the steps taken in a "Sprint".

Like any big or small project, first comes the planning stage. With **sprints** first comes the **sprint planning**.Sprint planning is a collaborative event where the team answers two basic questions: 

1. What work can get done in this sprint?

2. How will the chosen work get done?
***Think back to the times where you have been invlovled in a project. Have you ever accidently or deliberately asked yourself these questions?***

In a **Sprint** there are

- **Inputs :** List of ‘stuff’ that could potentially be part of the current sprint.
- **Outputs :** Describe the goal of the sprint and how they will start working toward that goal.

***Inbetween the two points mentioned above there are***

- **The What :** The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint. The scrum team decides what can be done in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to make that happen.
- **The How :** The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal.
- **The Who:** Each of the roles assinged for a project and what their tasks are specifically.

### Wait, what are these roles that I speak of?

Before I dive even deeper, let me explain who is involved in a **Scrum** project.

1. **Product Owner**

The main responsibility of a **Product Owner** is to ensure that the team is delivering the most value out of a project. The **Product Owner** reprisents the business itself. The **product owner** should understand the customer and have a clear vision for the value the scrum team is delivering to the customer.

2. **The Development Team**

These are the people who do the work and can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, programmers, etc.

3. **The Scrum Master**

They can be defined as the **anchor** that holds everything together. They ensure that the **scrum** is being done well. They aim to protect the team against blockers(things in the way of the project). They work individually with all the memebers and keep the standard of **scrum** at a high level.
