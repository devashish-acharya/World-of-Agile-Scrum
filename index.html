    <h1>What is this Website?</h1>
    <p>Here, you learn the basics of Agile Scrum.</p>
    <p>Firstly, Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development which provides ideas and
        pathways to deliver values to costumer in the most efficient way. Where Agile may be considered a mindset, Scrum
        is implimenting that mindset into something to get the result.
    </p>

    <p>So to expand, scrum is a framework for efficient and a high standard of collaboration. It is heavily embraced
        in the world of software engineering as it accepts changes openly but can be applied to all kinds of teamwork.
    </p>
    <p><b>Remember, Scrum can help you get more "Agile"</b></p>

    <h1>How exactly does scrum Work?</h1>

    <p>When a team uses scrum in a project, the product is built in a series of iterations called Sprint. This
        breaks down big complex projects into bitesize pieces. Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of
        "delivering working software frequently" as it drastically increases the efficiency of a project.</p>

    <h3>Diving deeper, now we learn about the steps taken in a "Sprint".</h3>
    <p>Like any big or small project, first comes the planning stage. With sprints first comes the sprint
        planning.Sprint planning is a collaborative event where the team answers two basic questions: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>What work can get done in this sprint?</li>
        <li>How will the chosen work get done?</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Think back to the times where you have been invlovled in a project. Have you ever accidently or deliberately
            asked yourself similar questions?</b></p>
    <h3>In sprint planning there are:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Inputs :</b> List of ‘stuff’ that could potentially be part of the current sprint.</li>
        <li><b>Outputs :</b> Describe the goal of the sprint and how they will start working toward that goal.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Inbetween the two points mentioned above there are:</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>The What :</b> The product owner describes the objective(or goal) of the sprint. The scrum team decides
            what
            can be done in the coming sprint and what they will do during the sprint to make that happen.</li>
        <li><b>The How : </b>The development team plans the work necessary to deliver the sprint goal.</li>
        <li><b>The Who :</b>Each of the roles assinged for a project and what their tasks are specifically.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Before I dive even deeper, let me explain who is involved in a Scrum project.</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Product Owner</b></li>

        <p>The main responsibility of a Product Owner is to ensure that the team is delivering the most value out of
            a project. The Product Owner reprisents the business itself. The product owner should understand the
            customer and have a clear vision for the value the scrum team is delivering to the customer.</p>

        <li><b>The Development Team</b></li>

        <p>These are the people who do the work and can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers,
            writers, programmers, etc.</p>

        <li><b>The Scrum Master</b></li>

        <p>They can be defined as the anchor that holds everything together. They ensure that the scrum is being
            done well. They aim to protect the team against blockers(things in the way of the project). They work
            individually with all the memebers and keep the standard of scrum at a high level.</p>

    </ol>
    <h3>The next step in a "Sprint" are <b>Daily Stand-up</b></h3>
    <p>Stand-up is designed to quickly inform everyone of what's going on across the team. It's not a detailed status
        meeting.This occurs once a day and is no more than 15 mins.</p>

    <p><b>The following questions are discussed.</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>What did I complete yesterday?</li>
        <li>What Will I work on today?</li>
        <li>Am I blocked by anything?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Next, there are sprint reviews</h3>
    <p>These are reviews that occur at the end of a sprint or a milestone.This is a time to showcase the work of the
        team. This is the time for the team to celebrate their accomplishments, demonstrate work finished within the
        iteration, and get immediate feedback from project stakeholders.</p>
    <p><b>Remember, Sprint reviews are not retrospectives(which we will talk about next). A sprint review is about
            demonstrating the hard work of the
            entire team: designers, developers, and the product owner.</b></p>

    <h3>Finally, we have retrospectives</h3>
    <p>A retrospective is anytime your team reflects on the past to improve the future. Between technical and
        non-technical teams, you can retro on just about anything!</p>
    <h3>And to wrap this all up, "Scrum of Scrums"</h3>
    <p>Scrum of Scrums is an agile technique that offers a way to connect multiple teams who need to work together
        to deliver complex solutions.</p>
    <p>It helps teams develop and deliver complex products through transparency, inspection, and adaptation, at scale.
        It’s particularly successful when all high-performing Scrum team members work towards a common goal, have trust,
        respect, and are completely aligned.</p>
    <h3>That covers all the basics of "Agile-Scrum", As I learn more, I will update this website to make it more
        presentable and add more information.</h3>
